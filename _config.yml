        subtitle: "Architecture for Online 3D Human Pose Estimation and Multi-person Tracking"
        detailed_description: |
            Robotic systems require precise information about the position and shape of objects along with future motion of surrounding persons in order to efficiently plan
            trajectories and safely collaborate with humans in a dynamic environment.
            We present an end-to-end multi-task CNN architecture which predicts object instances, human poses and tracks multiple people. Our method extends Mask R-CNN with a simple tracking head based on the MatchNet metric which relies exclusively on appearance cues. With a straightforward back-tracking algorithm we
            manage to re-identify lost tracks caused by detector failures or occlusions.
            Our method runs at ∼2.5Hz and is able to associate objects independent of spatio-temporal relations.
            Exploiting sensory information from RGB-D cameras and SLAM systems we aim
            to lay a solid step stone for generating arbitrary 3D human motion datasets and use
            those to train temporal models to predict human motion for future timestamps.

        subtitle: "RGB-D Instance Segmentation with Mask R-CNN"
        detailed_description: |
            Robotic systems require precise information about the geometry and the location
            of object instances for successful interactions with their surrounding environment.
            This involves the ability to extract information about previously unseen object instances from raw sensor data. Most methods approach this by segmenting RGB,
            depth, or point cloud data based on either geometrical cues or learned features.
            Whereas color-based segmentation approaches benefit from distinctive changes
            in appearance, they fail at identifying objects with similar texture or drastic illumination changes. On the other hand, geometrical approaches suffer from the
            inability to detect object instances that have invisible boundaries in depth images,
            such as flat objects. Furthermore, most of the learning-based approaches are restricted to RGB inputs as they require a large amount of training data to show good
            performance and only limited labeled RGB-D data is available. We extend
            an established convolutional neural network for instance-aware segmentation to
            work with RGB-D data, which substantially improves the object instance prediction accuracy, compared to sole RGB inputs. In our approach, we use the synthetic
            SceneNet RGB-D dataset with data augmentation to generate a large training set
            and we fine-tune our models using a limited set of labeled real-world data from
            the NYU Depth V2 dataset. Our method yields real-time performance running at
            over 11 fps. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real data.

        detailed_description: |
            The JET library offers a simple way to make Python, and especially NumPy code run faster. This is achieved by transparently converting Python/NumPy operations to performant C++.
            The computation graph is represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Nodes of the graph represent a specific operation and edges are the data that flows between the nodes.
            Instead of calling a huge, math-heavy Python/NumPy simulation model on every iteration JET packs the whole model in a single performant C++ function which results in a significant speed-up (up to 60-fold speed up was observed in a simulation of a math-heavy quadcopter-model).

        detailed_description: |
            The Omnicopter is a 44 cm×44 cm×44 cm cube-framed UAV with 8 rotors attached on its space diagonals.
            This work presents the synthesis of control algorithms in order to balance the Omnicopter on both its edges and corners on the floor.
            Some attitude representations are introduced, with emphasis on
            the quaternion-parametrisation. The rigid-body dynamics of the inverted 3D
            pendulum model are derived and a steering system which allows guidance of
            the balancing maneuvers by the end user is described. The nonlinear attitude
            control system utilized is presented and an onboard implementation is introduced using the Kalman filter as a sensor fusion algorithm.
            Performance tests in simulations and experiments are included.
